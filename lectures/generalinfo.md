# COMP4187: Parallel Scientific Computing II

This is the course webpage for [COMP4187]({{< modulepage >}}). It
collects the exercises, syllabus, and notes. The source repository is
[hosted on GitHub]({{< repo >}}).

This submodule builds on Numerical Algorithms I (Parallel Scientific
Computing I) and introduces advanced topics in ODE integration
schemes, and spatial discretisation.

## Time and Place

In term 2 the course will run on Wednesdays at 12pm in **E245**. Links to
live code, the recording, a small amount of commentary, and the
blackboard notes appear [in the notes section]({{< ref "live-notes.md"
>}}) after the fact.

In the first week of term 2 (week beginning 10th January 2022), the lecture
is **online only**

## Syllabus

### Numerical Methods (Term 1)

- Topic 1: Spatial discretisation. Finite difference methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), stability, convergence, and consistency;
- Topic 2: Time dependent PDEs. Stability constraints for time-dependent PDEs, connection to eigenvalue analysis;
- Topic 3: Implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, and matrix representations of PDE operators;
- Topic 4: Advanced algorithms for PDEs. Fast methods of solving PDEs, high order discretisation schemes.

### Parallel Computing (Term 2)

- Distributed memory programming models: [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org).

- Parallel algorithms and data structures for finite difference codes.

- Measurement and modelling. Analysis of achieved performance,
  performance models, including the Roofline model.
  
- Use of the [PETSc](https://petsc.org) library for parallel computing.

- Irregular data distribution and load-balancing.


### Discussion forum

We have set up a [discussion forum]({{< repo >}}/discussions) where you
can ask, and answer, questions. You'll need a
[GitHub](https://github.com) account to use it, but you've all got one
of those already, right? Note that this repository and forum is
publically visible.

### Office hours
We're happy to answer any questions in office hours, email to arrange a time.
