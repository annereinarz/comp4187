    "1. The \"downwind\" discretisation is unstable (blowing up near the boundary). The upwind version is stable, if we have a small enough time step. This makes physical sense, because the downwind discretisation is trying to obtain information \"from the future\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The upwind discretisation is *dissipative*: the correct physical solution is just to transport the initial condition to the right, but we see that the peak spreads and flattens.\n",
